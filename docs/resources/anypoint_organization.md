# anypoint_organization (Resource)

Creates and manages an Anypoint Platform organization (business group).

~> **Note:** This is an Access Management resource and requires the **admin provider** (`anypoint.admin`), which uses admin user credentials along with the `client_id` and `client_secret` of a connected app to authenticate on behalf of the user (`auth_type = "user"`). You must set `provider = anypoint.admin` on this resource. The default provider (connected app credentials only) does not have sufficient privileges for Access Management operations.

## Entitlement State Behaviour

The provider honours **user-defined state** for entitlements, not Platform defaults.

- If you declare an entitlement field in your Terraform config, the provider manages it: any Platform-side change will be reverted on the next `apply`.
- If you **omit** an entitlement field, the provider treats it as unmanaged. Platform-side updates to that field are not reflected in the plan and will not be reverted.
- Master-org-only entitlements (`hybrid`, `flex_gateway`, `service_mesh`, `worker_logging_override`, `runtime_fabric`, `design_center`) are inherited on sub-orgs and **cannot** be set via this resource on a business group. They are stripped from API requests to prevent HTTP 403 errors.

> **In short:** only declare entitlement fields you want Terraform to own. Leave everything else out of your config.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Admin provider – authenticates on behalf of a user using connected app credentials
provider "anypoint" {
  alias         = "admin"
  auth_type     = "user"
  client_id     = var.anypoint_admin_client_id
  client_secret = var.anypoint_admin_client_secret
  username      = var.anypoint_admin_username
  password      = var.anypoint_admin_password
  base_url      = var.anypoint_base_url
}

resource "anypoint_organization" "example" {
  provider = anypoint.admin

  name                   = "my-sub-org"
  parent_organization_id = "parent-org-id"
  owner_id               = "owner-user-id"

  entitlements = {
    create_sub_orgs     = false
    create_environments = true
    global_deployment   = false

    vcores_production = {
      assigned = 0
    }

    vcores_sandbox = {
      assigned = 0
    }

    vcores_design = {
      assigned = 0
    }

    vpcs = {
      assigned = 0
    }

    network_connections = {
      assigned = 0
    }

    managed_gateway_small = {
      assigned = 0
    }

    managed_gateway_large = {
      assigned = 0
    }
  }
}
```

Read-Only:

- `name` (String) The environment name.
- `organization_id` (String) The organization ID.

## Import

Existing Anypoint organizations can be imported using their organization ID:

```shell
terraform import anypoint_organization.example_org 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

Your HCL must declare `name`, `parent_organization_id`, and `owner_id` before you import — those are Required attributes on the resource. The first `terraform plan` after import refreshes all Read-Only and Optional attributes (including entitlements) from the Anypoint API.

`parent_organization_id` is derived from the server-returned ancestor chain (`parent_organization_ids`) on the first refresh. If the derivation doesn't match what you wrote in HCL, update the HCL to match — changing `parent_organization_id` triggers a destroy+recreate because it has the `RequiresReplace` plan modifier.
